In this directory you can find a first draft of a javascript ANPR dashboard that uses chartjs and mapbox gl js.

This version is a first draft to discuss future developments.
For now data is local and is loaded synchronously, but the code can be easily modified to load only partial data at first and then to asynchronously load bulk data. An API is currently in the works to load data remotely from the DAF.
